# Functions to be implemented ----------------------------------

def intToStr(labels):
    '''
        convert list of integers to string
    Args: 
        labels: list of ints
    Returns:
        string with space-separated characters
    '''

def strToInt(text):
    '''
        convert string to list of integers
    Args:
        text: string
    Returns:
        list of ints
    '''

def dataProcessing(data, transform):
    '''
    process a batch of speech data
    arguments:
        data: list of tuples, representing one batch. Each tuple is of the form
            (waveform, sample_rate, utterance, speaker_id, chapter_id, utterance_id)
        transform: audio transform to apply to the waveform
    returns:
        a tuple of (spectrograms, labels, input_lengths, label_lengths) 
        -   spectrograms - tensor of shape B x C x T x M 
            where B=batch_size, C=channel, T=time_frames, M=mel_band.
            spectrograms are padded the longest length in the batch.
        -   labels - tensor of shape B x L where L is label_length. 
            labels are padded to the longest length in the batch. 
        -   input_lengths - list of half spectrogram lengths before padding
        -   label_lengths - list of label lengths before padding
    '''
    
def greedyDecoder(output, blank_label=28):
    '''
    decode a batch of utterances 
    arguments:
        output: network output tensor, shape B x T x C where B=batch_size, T=time_steps, C=characters
        blank_label: id of the blank label token
    returns:
        list of decoded strings
    '''

def levenshteinDistance(ref,hyp):
    '''
    calculate levenshtein distance (edit distance) between two sequences
    arguments:
        ref: reference sequence
        hyp: sequence to compare against the reference
    output:
        edit distance (int)
